              My name is Facundo Faccioli, and I'm from Devoto, CÃ³rdoba,
              Argentina. For many years I had been studying Electromechanical
              Engineering, but in the pandemic I started asking if that was what
              I really want to dedicate my life. Researching and trying new
              things I notice that I really like web development, so in 2021 I
              started with the Frontend Coderhouse courses. In 2022, I decide to
              take in serious this matter and start the Soy Henry's FullStack
              Bootcamp. It was an excelent experience where I had learned most
              of the web development things I know now. At this moment, I am
              looking for my first IT job where I want to prove my knowledge and
              keep learning just to be, every day, a better developer.
